## RSA Algorithm
RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.
## Paillier Cryptosystem
Proposed in 1999 by Paillier (1999), the Paillier cryptosystem is based on the problem that computing nth residue classes is computationally intensive. Paillier cryptosystem is a public-key encryption system that allows one to perform operations such as addition and scalar multiplication over encrypted data. It is based on the mathematics of the modular arithmetic and number theory.
