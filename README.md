# PaulierAndRsaAlgorithm

## RSA Algorithm
RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys, i.e., Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes, the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.

## Paillier Cryptosystem
Proposed in 1999 by Paillier (1999), the Paillier cryptosystem is based on the problem that computing nth residue classes is computationally intensive. Paillier cryptosystem is a public-key encryption system that allows one to perform operations such as addition and scalar multiplication over encrypted data. It is based on the mathematics of modular arithmetic and number theory.

## SecureRSAExchange
The "SecureRSAExchange" is an enhanced version of the RSA Algorithm combined with the Paillier Cryptosystem, offering a robust and secure method for cryptographic operations. It leverages the strengths of both RSA and Paillier to provide a reliable and efficient solution for secure communication and data encryption.

## Getting Started
To test out both the RSA Algorithm and the Paillier Cryptosystem, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsadee/PaulierAndRsaAlgorithm.git
